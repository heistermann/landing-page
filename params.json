{"name":"WRADLIB","tagline":"An Open Source Library for Weather Radar Data Processing","body":"### Welcome to **wradlib**\r\nThe wradlib project has been initiated in order facilitate the use of weather radar data as well as to provide a common platform for research on new algorithms. wradlib is an open source library which is well documented and easy to use. It is written in the free programming language Python.\r\n\r\n### Focus\r\nWeather radar data is potentially useful in meteorology, hydrology and risk management. Its ability to provide information on precipitation with high spatio-temporal resolution over large areas makes it an invaluable tool for short term weather forecasting or flash flood forecasting.\r\n\r\n### About\r\nwradlib is designed to assist you in the most important steps of processing weather radar data. These may include: reading common data formats, georeferencing, converting reflectivity to rainfall intensity, identifying and correcting typical error sources (such as clutter or attenuation) and visualising the data.\r\n\r\n### Users\r\nYour feedback will contribute to the future development of wradlib! To provide feedback, use the [issue page](https://github.com/wradlib/wradlib/issues) and create an issue (bug reports, suggestions, ...).\r\n\r\nWe also encourage you to register to the mailing list [wradlib users](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/wradlib-users). Using this mailing list or forum, you can ask other users and developers for help and help others, and we can notify you about the latest updates and developments.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
